    "Seaborn is a popular Python data visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. Here are five common plots you can create using Seaborn and their typical uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scatter Plot:\n",
    "   Use: A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. Each point on the plot represents a data point, making it easy to identify patterns or correlations between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bar Plot:\n",
    "   Use: Bar plots are used to display categorical data with rectangular bars. They are great for showing comparisons between different categories or groups. For example, you can use bar plots to compare sales figures for different products.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Histogram:\n",
    "   Use: Histograms are used to display the distribution of a single numerical variable. They divide the data into bins and display the frequency or density of data points within each bin, making it easy to understand the data's underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot):\n",
    "   Use: Box plots are useful for visualizing the distribution and summary statistics of a numerical variable. They show the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the data. Box plots are especially helpful for identifying the spread and skewness of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Heatmap:\n",
    "   Use: Heatmaps are great for displaying the relationships between two categorical variables. They use color to represent the strength of the relationship or correlation between variables. Heatmaps are commonly used in data analysis and correlation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the many types of plots you can create using Seaborn. Seaborn provides a variety of other plots, such as line plots, violin plots, pair plots, and more, which can be valuable for different data analysis and visualization needs."
