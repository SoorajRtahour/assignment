    "A distplot, short for distribution plot, is a graphical representation that combines a histogram and a kernel density estimate (KDE) to provide a visual representation of the univariate distribution of a dataset.

A distplot typically consists of a histogram that shows the distribution of data points and a smooth curve (KDE) that provides an estimate of the probability density function.\n",
