    "You can create a Bokeh plot using Python by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Bokeh**: If you haven't already, you need to install the Bokeh library. You can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Bokeh**: Import the necessary modules and classes from Bokeh in your Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Data**: Prepare your data that you want to visualize. Bokeh can work with various data sources, including NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, or simple Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Figure**: Create a Bokeh figure object, which serves as the canvas for your plot. You can specify various attributes like plot dimensions, titles, and labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot = figure(title=\"My Bokeh Plot\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis Label\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis Label\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add Glyphs**: Add glyphs (visual elements) to the figure to represent your data. Bokeh supports a wide range of glyph types, including lines, circles, rectangles, and more. For example, to create a scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 8]\n",
    "   plot.circle(x, y, size=10, color=\"blue\", legend_label=\"My Data\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Customize the Plot**: You can customize the plot by adjusting various attributes like colors, markers, line styles, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Show the Plot**: Use the `show` function to display your Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   show(plot)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Save the Plot (Optional)**: You can save the plot as an HTML file or an image using Bokeh's export capabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "A Bokeh server is a component of the Bokeh library that allows you to create and deploy interactive web applications and dashboards with real-time updating capabilities. Bokeh server enables you to build dynamic, interactive plots and applications where users can interact with the visualizations, and the data and plots can update in response to user actions or external data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can use a Bokeh server to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Bokeh**:\n",
    "   If you haven't already, install the Bokeh library using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Bokeh and Other Dependencies**:\n",
    "   Import the necessary modules and classes from Bokeh and other libraries, depending on your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource\n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure, curdoc\n",
    "   from bokeh.io import push_notebook, show\n",
    "   from bokeh.layouts import column\n",
    "   from bokeh.models.widgets import Button\n",
    "   from bokeh.events import ButtonClick\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Your Plot**:\n",
    "   Create your Bokeh plot as you normally would, using the `figure` function. You can add various glyphs and customize the plot according to your requirements.\n",

    "   plot.line('x', 'y', source=source)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Callback Function**:\n",
    "   To enable real-time updates, you need to define a callback function. This function will be triggered when an event occurs, such as a button click or a data source update. In this example, we use a button to trigger the callback function.\n",
    "():\n",
    "       # Perform updates to the data source\n",

    "       source.stream(new_data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create Widgets and Events**:\n",
    "   To interact with the plot, you can create widgets such as buttons, sliders, or text inputs, and define the events that trigger the callback function. In this example, we use a button to trigger the `update` function.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   layout = column(plot, update_button)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Run the Bokeh Server**:\n",
    "   Use `curdoc().add_root(layout)` to add the layout to the document. Then, run the Bokeh server to serve the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "   curdoc().add_root(layout)\n",

    "8. **Interact and Update**:\n",
    "   Users can interact with the plot and trigger the update by clicking the button (or other widgets, depending on your application). The callback function will update the data source, and the plot will be updated in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic example, and Bokeh server allows for more complex interactive applications with multiple components and real-time data sources. You can also use periodic callbacks or WebSocket connections to update data dynamically from external sources.\n",

    "\n",
    "   script, div = components(plot)  # 'plot' is your Bokeh figure\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Django View**: In your Django app, create a view function that renders an HTML template and passes the `script` and `div` components as context variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   from django.shortcuts import render\n",
    "\n",

    "   from django.urls import path\n",
    "\n",
    "   urlpatterns = [\n",
    "       path('plot/', show_plot, name='show_plot'),\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Run Your Django App**: Run your Django development server using `python manage.py runserver` and access the `/plot` URL to see the embedded Bokeh plot in the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using either Flask or Django, depending on your web development framework of choice."
