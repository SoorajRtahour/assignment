    "   - *Example:* If you have a dataset of exam scores for a class, you might calculate the average (mean) score to represent the typical performance and the standard deviation to measure the spread of scores.\n",

    "   - *Definition:* Nominal data represent categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking.\n",

    "3. **Interval Level:**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* Interval data have a meaningful order, and the intervals between values are consistent. However, there is no true zero point.\n",
    "   - *Example:* Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The difference between 20 and 30 degrees is the same as the difference between 30 and 40 degrees, but zero does not indicate the absence of temperature.\n",

    "  - Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division make sense.\n",
    "  - You can calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Gender\" is at the nominal level because it represents categories (male, female) without any inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Implications:**\n",
    "  - Arithmetic operations don't make sense (you can't add or subtract genders).\n",
    "  - You can calculate modes and percentages but not meaningful means or medians.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to mistakenly treat \"Number of Siblings\" as nominal data, you might try to calculate the mode or percentage, which might not be meaningful. Conversely, if you treated \"Gender\" as a ratio variable and calculated the mean, it wouldn't provide any meaningful information because you can't perform meaningful arithmetic operations on gender categories.\n",

Therefore, correctly identifying and understanding the level of measurement is fundamental for selecting the appropriate statistical techniques and ensuring the validity of results."
