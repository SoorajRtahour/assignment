    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value.

    "1. Nature of Trials:\n",

    "   - Poisson Distribution: It models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming a continuous process where events occur at a known average rate but independently of the time since the last event.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Number of Possible Outcomes:\n",
    "   - Binomial Distribution: Has a finite number of trials with discrete outcomes.\n",
    "   - Poisson Distribution: Deals with an infinite number of potential occurrences within a continuous interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameters:\n",
    "   - Binomial Distribution: Characterized by \\(n\\) (the number of trials) and \\(p\\) (the probability of success in each trial).\n",
    "   - Poisson Distribution: Characterized by a single parameter \\(\\lambda\\) (the average rate of occurrence).\n",

    "4. Assumptions:\n",
    "   - Binomial Distribution: Assumes a fixed number of trials and a constant probability of success in each trial.\n",
    "   - Poisson Distribution: Assumes events occur randomly and independently at a constant average rate.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Binomial Distribution: Often used when there's a fixed number of trials, such as coin flips, dice rolls, or the number of successes in a specific number of experiments.\n",
    "   - Poisson Distribution: Applied in scenarios where events occur continuously and independently at a known average rate, like the number of phone calls at a call center within a specific time frame or the number of arrivals at a service point within a given interval.\n",
