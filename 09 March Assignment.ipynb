    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used to describe the probabilities of different outcomes in a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "- The PMF is used for discrete random variables, assigning probabilities to specific values of the variable.\n",
    "- It gives the probability that a discrete random variable will take on a certain value.\n",
    "- For each possible outcome, the PMF returns the probability of that outcome occurring.\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "- The PDF is used for continuous random variables.\n",
    "- Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to specific values, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of the variable taking on different values within a range.\n",
    "- It represents the probability density per unit of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PMF Example (Discrete):\n",
    "   Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die. The PMF for the outcomes of rolling the die gives the probability of getting each number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) in a single roll. For a fair die, each outcome has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) (assuming no bias).\n",

    "   Imagine the heights of adult humans. The PDF for human heights represents the distribution of heights within a population. It doesn't give the probability of a specific height but shows the probability density across a range of heights. For instance, the PDF might indicate that heights around the average (e.g., 5'7\" or 170 cm) are more likely than extremely tall or short heights.\n",
