    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "- A point estimate is a single value that is calculated from sample data and is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. For instance, using the sample mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) to estimate the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) or using the sample proportion (\\(p\\)) to estimate the population proportion (\\(P\\)) are examples of point estimates. Point estimates provide a specific value as an estimation of the population parameter but don't convey information about the accuracy or reliability of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "- An interval estimate provides a range of values that is likely to contain the unknown population parameter. It includes both a lower and an upper limit within which the true population parameter is expected to fall with a certain level of confidence. This range is often expressed as a confidence interval (e.g., a 95% confidence interval for the population mean). Confidence intervals give an estimation of the precision or uncertainty around the point estimate and convey information about the reliability of the estimate.\n",

    "In summary, estimation statistics involves deriving estimators (point estimates) and constructing confidence intervals (interval estimates) to infer unknown population parameters from sample data. Point estimates provide specific values, while interval estimates give a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a specified level of confidence."
