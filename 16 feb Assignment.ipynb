    "A1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information. It serves as a central repository for various types of data, making it easier to store, access, and analyze information for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure: SQL databases use a structured schema to define the relationships between tables, which are used to store data in rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of that record.\n",
    "2. Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with SQL databases. It provides a standard way to query, insert, update, and delete data from the database.\n",
    "3. Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity through features like foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and data types. This ensures that data follows predefined rules and maintains consistency.\n",
    "4. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased loads by upgrading hardware and resources of a single server. However, there are limits to scalability, and performance can degrade beyond certain thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure: NoSQL databases use a variety of data models like key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs. The schema can be dynamic, allowing flexible storage of data without a fixed structure.\n",
    "2. Language: Each NoSQL database may have its own query language, although some support SQL-like query languages for specific operations. Generally, NoSQL databases provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to interact with data.\n",
    "3. Data Integrity: NoSQL databases often prioritize performance and scalability over strong data integrity enforcement. However, some NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency or other mechanisms to handle data consistency in distributed environments.\n",
    "4. Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically designed to be horizontally scalable, which means they can handle increased loads by adding more servers to the distributed system. This enables better performance and scalability for large-scale applications and big data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the data model, performance needs, scalability, and data consistency requirements. SQL databases are commonly used for applications with well-defined schemas and complex relationships between data, while NoSQL databases are often preferred for applications that require high scalability and flexibility in handling unstructured or rapidly changing data."

DDL statements are used to create, alter, and delete database objects like tables, indexes, and views. These statements do not deal with the manipulation of data itself but rather focus on defining the schema and structure of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain the commonly used DDL statements with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or databases. The syntax for creating a table is as follows:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column1 datatype1 constraints,\n",

    "  emp_age INT,\n",
    "  emp_department VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "1. DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to delete database objects such as tables, indexes, or views from the database. Be cautious when using the DROP statement, as it permanently removes the object and its data.\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's drop the \"employees\" table that we created earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "1. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns from a table, change data types, or add constraints.\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "  ADD emp_email VARCHAR(100);\n",

    "1. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively deleting all data within the table. However, it does not delete the table structure, and the table remains available for further data insertion.\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",

    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in database design that define relationships between tables in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures that each record in the table is distinct and identifiable. Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity and to establish relationships with other tables through foreign keys.\n",
    "Characteristics of a Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique; no two rows can have the same value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "Not Null: Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values; they must have valid, non-null data for each row.\n",
    "Fixed: Primary key values generally do not change over time, as they serve as stable identifiers for the records.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table called \"employees\" with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "emp_id (Primary Key)\temp_name\temp_age \temp_department\n",
    "1\t                    John Doe\t 30\t        Sales\n",

    "3\t                    Mike Brown\t 35\t        Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"emp_id\" column serves as the primary key for the \"employees\" table, ensuring that each employee has a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing you to maintain referential integrity. A foreign key in one table points to the primary key in another table, creating a link between related data.\n",
    "Characteristics of a Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "References Primary Key: The values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the related table.\n",
    "Ensures Referential Integrity: Foreign keys help maintain referential integrity by preventing the creation of orphaned records, i.e., records that refer to non-existent records in the related table.\n",
    "Multiple Foreign Keys: A table can have multiple foreign keys, each referencing a different table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"employees\" and \"departments,\" with the following structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "employees table:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example above, the cursor() method is used to create a cursor object named \"cursor,\" and the execute() method is used to execute the SQL query stored in the variable \"sql_query.\" The fetchall() method is then used to retrieve all rows returned by the query, and the data is printed in the for loop. Finally, the cursor and connection are closed to release resources and close the connection to the MySQL server.\n"

    "\n",
    "5. HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped results based on specified conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause, but it works with the results of the GROUP BY clause.\n",
