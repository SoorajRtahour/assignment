    "In Pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is one of the core data structures provided by Pandas and is designed to hold and manipulate structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key characteristics of a Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tabular Structure: A DataFrame represents data in a tabular form, where data is organized into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Heterogeneous Data: Each column in a DataFrame can hold data of different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). This allows you to work with mixed data types within the same DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Labeled Axes: Both rows and columns in a DataFrame have labels or index values, making it easy to access and manipulate specific data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Size Mutable: You can add, remove, or modify rows and columns in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's compare a DataFrame with a Pandas Series using an example:\n",

    "print(df)\n",

    "The ser variable represents a Pandas Series. It's a one-dimensional labeled array, and in this case, it contains a list of numbers.\n",

    "The df variable represents a Pandas DataFrame. It's a two-dimensional structure with labeled columns ('Name', 'Age', 'Gender') and rows (0, 1, 2). It holds more structured data, including not just numbers but also strings (names and genders), making it suitable for tabular data like a dataset of people's information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference between a Pandas Series and a DataFrame is that a Series is one-dimensional and typically used for a single column of data, whereas a DataFrame is two-dimensional, tabular, and designed to handle multiple columns of data, making it suitable for working with structured datasets like spreadsheets or database tables"
