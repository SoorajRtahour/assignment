    "In Python, an exception is an unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow. When an exceptional situation arises, such as division by zero, accessing an index beyond the bounds of a list, or attempting to convert an invalid data type, Python raises an exception to indicate that something went wrong. Exceptions can occur at runtime and can be caused by various factors like user input, external resources, or programming errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of exceptions in Python, and they are represented by specific classes. Some common built-in exception types in Python include ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError, etc. Additionally, Python allows you to create your own custom exception classes to handle specific situations unique to your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the runtime of a Python program.\n",
    "They are raised when an error or unexpected situation occurs while the code is executing.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, etc.\n",
    "Exceptions can often be handled using try and except blocks to prevent the program from crashing and to provide graceful error handling.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase, which is the initial stage when Python is trying to understand the code structure.\n",
    "They are raised when the code violates the rules of the Python language grammar, making it unable to understand the code.\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, invalid variable names, etc.\n",
    "Syntax errors need to be fixed in the code before the program can run. The code won't execute until the syntax errors are resolved.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between an exception and a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num1  # This line may raise a ZeroDivisionError if num1 is 0.\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "In this example, if the user enters 0 as the num1, a ZeroDivisionError exception will be raised and handled by the except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Error Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code has a syntax error.\n",
    "for i in range(5)\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "In this example, there's a missing colon (:) after range(5), which will cause a syntax error. The code won't execute until the colon is added to the end of the for statement."

    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it will cause the program to terminate abruptly, and an error message (called a traceback) will be displayed, indicating the type of exception and the line number where it occurred.

    "\n",
    "Since we did not handle the ZeroDivisionError with a try-except block, the program terminates immediately after displaying the traceback. Any code that was supposed to execute after the point of the exception will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid unhandled exceptions, it is a good practice to use try and except blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages or corrective actions when exceptional situations occur during the program execution.
